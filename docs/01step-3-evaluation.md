# Evaluation

**Evaluation**: What defines success? *expected output, this is crucial as ML is experimental in nature, we can go forever trying to find a solution. Hence success criteria is important. There is not perfect ML model for a solution do not exits*

*example evaluation statement: whats the success criteria - 90% accuracy, is it ok to go ahead with the project*.

*example scenario: build a ML model from error message whether to go for P1 or not, with a 99% accuracy*.

> NOTE: the accuracy again depends on what type of data you are dealing with. For example: if its predicting any diseases, its critical, compared to predicting a cat. This is a common goal team of data scientist and machine learning engineer will work on.

## Different evaluation metric

For Classification problem:

- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**

For Regression problem:

- **mean absolute error(MAE)**
- **mean squared error(MSE)**
- **Root mean square error(RMSE)**

For Recommendation problem:

- **Precision at K**
