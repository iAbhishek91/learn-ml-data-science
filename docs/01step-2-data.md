# Data

**Data**: What kind of data do we have? *is the data in excel? is it structured or unstructured?, is the data text or audio or images?*

## Two different classification

- **Structured**:
  - All the data in the dataset are in similar format.
  - They can are table(csv, excel) or json or yaml format data which have specific structure.
  - *For example: patient data from a hospital, customer data*

- **Unstructured**:
  - have no pre-defined structure
  - *For example: are post from social media, natural language processing, audio stream, images*

## Two ingestion type of data

- static data
- streaming data

> note: general practice is that we start any Ml work with static data, and then move to streaming data later.
