# ML

Machine learning is a science of getting machine to act without being explicitly programmed.

In other words, ML is using an algorithm or a program to learn different pattern in a data (dataset) and make prediction on the other data in future.

Anther definition, write a code which can bring the inside out of a data.

Machine learning programs are know as **models**(used interchangeably)

## What is the difference between normal algorithm and ML algorithms  (models)

**Normal algorithm** are set of instruction which are executed to get a desired outputs. Your have, the *inputs*(data) and a *set of instructions*(steps to be followed). For example a sorting algorithm.

**ML Algorithm** are also a program, but instead starting with *inputs* and *set of instructions*, we start with *input* and *ideal output* and the program finds out/predict the steps/set of instructions to interpret the next set of input based on that.

>Note the output is not exact output, but an ideal one. AS we not sure how to derive/calculate that output, we need to find/predict them using ML. So basically we give some dataset to a program, and mention their outputs, based on this, machine learning algorithm will learn/train itself about later for any related data it can predict the output. More you train the data more accurate the result becomes and can take more realistic decisions.
